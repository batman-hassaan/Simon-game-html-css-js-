# Simon Game 🎮🧠
A fun and interactive memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project is inspired by the classic Simon game, where users test their ability to remember and replicate sequences of colors. The game gets progressively harder as the sequence grows longer with every correct round.

## Features ✨
- Dynamic Color Sequences: Randomly generated color sequences for every game.
- User Interaction: Players can click on the colored quadrants to replicate the sequence.
- Score Tracking: Displays the current score and the highest score achieved.
- Game Feedback: Provides immediate feedback for correct and incorrect inputs.
- Replay Option: Reset and play again with a fresh sequence.
## How It Works 🛠️
1. The game starts with a randomly generated color sequence.
2. The sequence is displayed to the user with a blinking animation.
3. The user replicates the sequence by clicking the colored quadrants.
4. If the user enters the correct sequence:
  -  Their score increases.
  - A new color is added to the sequence.
5. If the user enters an incorrect sequence:
6. The game ends, and their highest score is saved.
7. They can restart the game by clicking the "Play Again" button.
## Technologies Used 💻
- HTML: For the structure of the game interface.
- CSS: For styling the quadrants, buttons, and score display.
- JavaScript: For the game logic, including:
- Random sequence generation.
- User input handling and validation.
- Score and highest score tracking.
- Animation and interactive effects.
## How to Play ▶️
- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Watch the color sequence carefully.
- Click the colored quadrants in the same order as displayed.
- Keep going for as long as you can remember the sequence!
- Try to beat your highest score!
## File Structure 📁
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the game structure.
- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- simon.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
## Preview 🎨
The game interface includes:

- A circular board divided into four colored quadrants (red, blue, green, yellow).
- A score display for the current and highest scores.
- "Play Again" and "Quit" buttons for user control.
## What I Learned 🧑‍💻
This project helped me practice and understand several important JavaScript concepts, including:

- DOM Manipulation: Updating the UI dynamically based on game events.
- Event Listeners: Handling user inputs via clicks.
- Randomization: Generating random color sequences.
- Timing Functions: Using setTimeout for animations and delays.
- Game Logic: Implementing logic to compare user inputs with the generated sequence.
## Future Enhancements 🚀
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., faster animations or longer sequences).
- Include sound effects for better feedback.
- Implement a leaderboard to display top scores.
## Getting Started 🛠️
